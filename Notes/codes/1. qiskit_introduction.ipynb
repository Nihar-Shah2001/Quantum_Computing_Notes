    "Qiskit provides an abstraction layer that lets users run quantum circuits on hardware from any vendor that provides a compatible interface. The best way to Qiskit is with a runtime environment that provides a compatible interface. The best way to use Qiskit is with a runtime environment that provides optimized implementations of sampler and estimator for a given hardwre platform. This runtime may involve using pre- and post-processing, such as optimized transpiler passes with error_suprpression, error mitigation, and, eventually error corresction built in. A runtime implements qiskit.primitive.BaseEstimator interfaces. For example, some packages that provide implementations of a runtime primitive implementation are: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime\n",
